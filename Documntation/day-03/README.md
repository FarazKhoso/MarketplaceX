# Day 3 - API Integration and Data Migration ðŸš€

## Overview

Today, I successfully completed **Day 3** of my website development journey. The main focus was transforming my website into a fully dynamic platform by integrating APIs, migrating data to Sanity CMS, and linking products to their dynamic detail pages. This day was both challenging and rewarding, and I gained valuable insights into building scalable and interactive e-commerce platforms.

## Key Objectives Accomplished:
1. **API Integration:**
   - Learned to fetch data using APIs and dynamically display it on the website.
   - Implemented error handling to ensure a smooth user experience during data retrieval.

2. **Sanity CMS Migration:**
   - Migrated product data from APIs into Sanity CMS.
   - Ensured that schemas were validated and compatible with the API data structure.

3. **Dynamic Detail Pages:**
   - Created unique, dynamic pages for each product using their `slug`.
   - Connected each product to its detail page, allowing seamless navigation.

## Steps Taken

1. **Understanding API Integration:**
   - Reviewed the API documentation for the data sources.
   - Created utility functions to fetch and process API data.

2. **Schema Validation and Adjustment:**
   - Compared API fields with the existing Sanity schema and made adjustments for compatibility.
   - Mapped fields such as `name`, `price`, `slug`, and `description`.

3. **Data Migration:**
   - Used migration scripts to import data into Sanity CMS.
   - Validated the imported data in Sanity to ensure all products were correctly populated.

4. **Dynamic Routing in Next.js:**
   - Configured dynamic routes in Next.js using `[slug]`.
   - Rendered product-specific details based on the `slug` parameter.

## Challenges Faced

- **Handling API Errors:** Ensured robust error handling for failed API calls by displaying fallback messages.
- **Schema Compatibility:** Adjusted schemas to align with API field names and types.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Debugged issues with routing and rendering product pages dynamically.
