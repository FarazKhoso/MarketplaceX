# Day 2: Planning the Technical Foundation ðŸš€

## Overview
On **Day 2**, we transitioned from business-oriented planning to the **technical foundation** required to build a robust and scalable marketplace. This involved defining clear technical requirements, designing a high-level system architecture, planning API requirements, and drafting Sanity schemas for managing data efficiently.

## Goals Achieved
1. **Technical Requirements Defined**:
   - User-friendly interface with responsive design.
   - Pages planned: Home, Product Listing, Product Details, Cart, and Checkout.
   - Integration of Sanity CMS for data management and third-party APIs for functionality like payments and shipment tracking.

2. **System Architecture Designed**:
   - High-level diagram showcasing interaction between:
     - **Frontend** (Next.js).
     - **Sanity CMS** (managing product, order, and customer data).
     - **Third-party APIs** (for payment and shipping).
   - Data flow visualized to ensure seamless integration and efficiency.

3. **API Requirements Planned**:
   - API endpoints identified and documented for:
     - Fetching products (`GET /api/products`).
     - Creating orders (`POST /api/orders`).
     - Shipment tracking (`GET /api/shipment`).

4. **Sanity Schema Drafted**:
   - Schema created for **Products**, **Categories**, and **Orders** to streamline data storage and retrieval.

5. **Documentation Completed**:
   - Detailed technical documents prepared for architecture, workflows, and API design to serve as a blueprint for implementation.

## Key Takeaways
- **Hands-On Experience**:
  - Designed a system architecture that aligns with business goals.
  - Learned to integrate Sanity CMS and APIs into the development workflow.

- **Practical Skills Developed**:
  - Transitioning from business goals to technical specifications.
  - Writing professional-level technical documentation.
  - Planning for scalable and efficient data management.

## Challenges Faced
1. Aligning business requirements with technical feasibility.
2. Designing scalable APIs and workflows for real-world scenarios.
3. Drafting comprehensive and reusable Sanity schemas.

## Conclusion
Day 2 was a deep dive into planning a marketplace's technical backbone. These efforts have laid a strong foundation for **Day 3**, where we will focus on API implementation and ensuring that the technical solutions support a seamless user experience.
